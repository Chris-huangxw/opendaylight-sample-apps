# next-tooltip-customization
This mini application is intended to show how you can customize tooltips.

## Why We Use TopologyContainer
Because with the container you can easily use all the advantages of a nx.ui.Component class, as well as display topology. nx.ui.Component allows you to bind events, create methods and do other things, while nx.graphic.Topology realizes the whole bunch of topology stuff. Combined together they let us enjoy coding with NeXt.
