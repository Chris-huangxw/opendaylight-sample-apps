The sample applications contained within the project are meant primarily to serve a examples for training purposes. We want developers inside and outside of Cisco to be able to use, improve, create, and share applications. These sample applications are to help educate the Cisco DevNet developer community on how to use OpenDaylight and to serve as starter applications for Cisco DevNet hackathons, etc.

Each application exists in its own subdirectory. Each application may have its own LICENSE and AUTHORS file, otherwise the ones in this project level directory apply.
